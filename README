A simple way to open a Rails files quickly

    controller survey

    controller survey item

This would open first the controller survey and the second will open two files 
that are both controller, one named survey and the other named item.

NOTE: this will only work if you are in your Rails project or you set your
`env` RAILS_ROOT to your Rails project.

    > RAILS_ROOT=~/repos/repo
    > export RAILS_ROOT
